## Requirements

An **XSLT** processor. Xalan, Saxon, MSXML, xsltproc, whatever.

A client for **PostgresSQL**. I pasted and loaded commands into psql on the server. Some of the commands listed here are meta-commands, which I am not sure work in outher clients.

An **(S)FTP** client for transferring load files and SQL scripts.

**CSV editing** software. Preferably not Microsoft Excel when editing CSV. If staff working on manual data cleansing prefer Excel, export it for them in that format and then re-import. Watch for corruptions like stripping leading zeros and futzing date formats. If necessary, explicitly set each cell to be of _Text_ type in Excel. LibreOffice is pretty safe but maybe not as nice for editing CSV files.
