## Appendage

It's the author's privilege to include boring prefatory/sufficatory material and here is mine, so let it be known.

The project is named in present continuous instead of "sympload(e)r" because I want it to sound like a process more than a tool.

### Sliding doors

This task might have taken different implementation directions and we may have found the universe completely different if this were so:

* I first thought as a solution to write Perl scripts (of course!). However, difficulties getting through our NTLM proxy to install modules (XML, CSV etc.) with PPM made that impractical.
* There's a solution that might have worked more cleanly that I only considered after going too far down the track documented here. What if I had got an XML dump of DSpace metadata, then created and cleaned the CSV from that using XSLT? Outputting properly escaped CSV from XSLT might have been a challenge, however.
