## The process outlined

If you accept our [assumptions](assumptions.md), meet our [requirements](requirements.md) and think this can work for you, even with a little coercion, here's what to do:

* [Understand load file specifications and requirements](process-specs.md)
* [Finish your mappings](process-mappings.md)
* [Create your load manifest](process-manifest.md)
* [Create and populate an initial metadata holding table](process-init-metadata.md)
* [Manipulate some data in the interim metadata table](process-massage-metadata.md)
* [Create and populate IR persons table](process-populate-persons.md)
* [Prepare matching names for links table](process-match-names.md)
* [Create and populate IR links table](process-populate-links.md)
* [Import and clean RM metadata](process-import-rm-metadata.md)
